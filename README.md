## Audio Fingerprinting

## Overview:

This project is an integral part of the Advanced Algorithms and Data Structures course, focusing on the concept of audio fingerprinting and the algorithms and code behind it.

## Introduction to Audio Fingerprinting

Audio fingerprinting involves identifying unique characteristics within audio recordings, much like identifying individual signatures or fingerprints. These characteristics include factors such as tone, amplitude, and wavelength. By recognizing this unique combination of attributes, entire audio recordings can be identified. This process finds applications in various fields, including pattern matching, multimedia (music) information retrieval, and cryptography.

## Applications

Audio fingerprinting has several practical applications:

- **Pattern Matching**: Allows matching of an audio snippet with its corresponding full-length recording.
- **Multimedia (Music) Information Retrieval**: Aids in the categorization and organization of audio content in digital libraries.
- **Cryptography**: Utilizes hashing to securely store audio fingerprints for authentication and verification purposes.

## Real-life Examples

One of the most well-known applications of audio fingerprinting is Shazam. Shazam creates a fingerprint of audio snippets and compares them with a vast database of stored fingerprints from various songs. This process enables users to quickly identify songs they are listening to.

## CODE TEMPLATE:

```
# Import necessary libraries
import numpy as np
import librosa
# Add any other libraries you may need for signal processing and feature extraction

# Define function to extract audio features and create fingerprint
def create_audio_fingerprint(audio_file):
    """
    Function to create an audio fingerprint from an audio file.
    
    Parameters:
    - audio_file: path to the audio file
    
    Returns:
    - fingerprint: a unique identifier for the audio file
    """
    # Step 1: Load audio file
    # Use librosa to load the audio file
    audio_data, sample_rate = librosa.load(audio_file)
    
    # Step 2: Preprocess audio data
    # Perform any preprocessing steps such as normalization, resampling, etc.
    
    # Step 3: Extract audio features
    # Use signal processing techniques to extract relevant features
    # Common features include spectral features, temporal features, etc.
    # You may use functions from librosa or other libraries for feature extraction
    
    # Step 4: Create fingerprint
    # Combine the extracted features into a unique fingerprint
    # This could involve hashing the features or using machine learning techniques
    
    # Step 5: Return fingerprint
    return fingerprint

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Replace 'audio_file_path' with the path to your audio file
    audio_file_path = "example_audio.wav"
    
    # Call the function to create the audio fingerprint
    fingerprint = create_audio_fingerprint(audio_file_path)
    
    # Print or use the generated fingerprint
    print("Audio fingerprint:", fingerprint)
