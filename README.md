## Audio Fingerprinting

## Overviewhttps:

This project is an integral part of the Advanced Algorithms and Data Structures course, focusing on the concept of audio fingerprinting and the algorithms and code behind it.

## Introduction to Audio Fingerprinting

Audio fingerprinting involves identifying unique characteristics within audio recordings, much like identifying individual signatures or fingerprints. These characteristics include factors such as tone, amplitude, and wavelength. By recognizing this unique combination of attributes, entire audio recordings can be identified. This process finds applications in various fields, including pattern matching, multimedia (music) information retrieval, and cryptography.

## Applications

Audio fingerprinting has several practical applications:

- **Pattern Matching**: Allows matching of an audio snippet with its corresponding full-length recording.
- **Multimedia (Music) Information Retrieval**: Aids in the categorization and organization of audio content in digital libraries.
- **Cryptography**: Utilizes hashing to securely store audio fingerprints for authentication and verification purposes.

## Real-life Examples

One of the most well-known applications of audio fingerprinting is Shazam. Shazam creates a fingerprint of audio snippets and compares them with a vast database of stored fingerprints from various songs. This process enables users to quickly identify songs they are listening to.
